Using this approach (Q-learning\nto be exact) the agent can quickly map out the safe path, then learn to navigate\nit faster.\nThis is still a pretty simple demonstrative algorithm, but the environment and\nthe ability to use Minecraft characters as experimental agents in an easy to\nunderstand and visual way is really cool and I hope to build and share more\ncomplex and multi agent scenarios soon!\n\n0:00/1×Malmo map solving with lava","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/minecraft-lava-trap.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-05-24T11:49:23.000Z","updated_at":"2022-05-24T14:15:00.000Z","published_at":"2021-09-14T12:09:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"628bad72d182030001125d37"},{"id":"628ccbf62c055d000197a103","uuid":"b9ae5c0f-9888-426e-9023-d4813d1ac084","title":"NextMind Experimentation","slug":"nextmind-experimentation","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/image-5.png\",\"width\":936,\"height\":1284,\"caption\":\"A NextMind device tracking PIN input\"}],[\"video\",{\"loop\":false,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2022/05/block.mp4\",\"fileName\":\"block.mp4\",\"width\":1920,\"height\":1080,\"duration\":17.5175,\"mimeType\":\"video/mp4\",\"thumbnailSrc\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/media-thumbnail-ember831.jpg\",\"thumbnailWidth\":1920,\"thumbnailHeight\":1080}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I've been lucky enough to play around with a NextMind dev kit.

Especially with chocolate, the heads can be very fragile,\nso be careful.\n\nI also made smaller lollipop size heads for a smaller tasty treat. This time I\nused candy melts to avoid making lots of tempered chocolate.

Getting access to it has been both\nincredibly exciting, but also a little bit terrifying.\n\nWhat is it?\nDALL-E is a combination of a powerful Natural Language Processing AI, meshed\nwith an even more powerful image generation AI.

However there have been two\nsignificant updates.\n\n 1. The Dall-E-2 API\n    [https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-api-now-available-in-public-beta/] is\n    finally here!\n 2. I figured out how to easily get from a flat texture to a full 3D one using \n    Materialize [https://boundingboxsoftware.com/materialize/].\n\nThe Dall-E-2 API make it infinitely easier to modify image in the way we meed\nto. Instead of manually doing all the image generation, we can thread it into a\nsingle python operation. \n\n💡Checkout the GitHub repo\n[https://github.com/FergusKidd/Seamless-Texture-Generation-with-DALL-E-2] and\ntry it yourselfI'll show you step by step what we generate. First let's ask\nthrough the API for a texture we might want to see. In this case I'm asking for\na yellow brick texture. \n\nDALL-E-2 generated texture of a yellow brick wallPretty good start. The problem\nis if we tile this nicely over a large 3D surface, it won't look good because\nthe edges won't match up. It 'tiles' horribly when we replicate the image many\ntimes. These always will. Let's move the 'seams' to the middle so we can see it\nbetter.\n\nSeams reorganised to the middleAll we've done here is move the outside in, by\nchopping the image into 4 and swapping the positions. Now we can see the seam in\nthe middle as if we were looking at 4 tiled images. It's not the worst seam\never, DALL-E-2 has done a very good job, but we can easily tell it's not right.\n\nThe next step we can do is to create an alpha mask on this image as we know\nwhere the seam is, it's in a nice cross shape in the centre.\n\nAlpha mask for the seamsThis is a representation of the mask, with areas to keep\nshowing through (in blue_ and areas to re-do in purple. So what can we do with\nthis? Well the great thing about the DALL-E-2 API, is that we can also edit\nimages. Sending the original image with the seams in the middle off with this\nmask and the original prompt will allow us to regenerate the seam area for\nhopefully a lovely smooth transition.\n\nThe second output from DALL-E-2, a now seamless textureAnd there we have it. You\ncan clearly see some new artefacts like the blue smudge on the brick in the\nmiddle, where the mask was. DALL-E-2 has regenerated the gaps we marked out, so\nnow the image is pretty much seamless and tile-able. Great!\n\nLet's make it 3D\nFor this to really be useable it doesn't just need to be seamless, it needs to\nhave depth, roughness, metallic layers. All sorts of additional information\nabout how light would interact with this texture in the real world, so we can\nbetter simulate it in a render engine. I previously thought this would be a\nmanual and labour intensive process until i found Materialzie\n[https://boundingboxsoftware.com/materialize/] from Bounding Box Software. This\nFREE tool takes 2D flat textures from a photo, or in our case AI, and makes them\npop by generating the other information we need.\n\nSome of the layers made using MaterializeThis is a huge improvement on our flat\ntile-able image. Let's have a look at what that looks like rendered.\n\nThe now 3D texture rendered with lighting and depthAnd there we go! A now usable\nseamless 3D texture, completely AI generated. This opens up a word of\nopportunities for amazing new on-demand texture rendering!\n\n💡The other nice thing about using the API is that the images don't seem to\ninclude the usual watermarking in the cornerHere's some more example outputs\njust for fun:\n\nWhite furAn Alien rocky planet surfaceNotice we may want to do some colour\nstabilisation accross the segments on these in the future.\n\nA good example of how things with regular patterns or directionality can go very\nwrong very quickly...\n\nGrass","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/11/Yellow-Brick-Cube-1.jpg","featured":1,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-11-04T16:08:36.000Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T19:25:06.000Z","published_at":"2022-11-04T16:48:18.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"628bad72d182030001125d37"},{"id":"639c46c456bf880001dc451e","uuid":"cf6f43ef-99e7-4119-801d-8552aac83579","title":"0 Data Vision Model","slug":"0-data-vision-model","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/12/Ball.png\",\"width\":1920,\"height\":1080}],[\"button\",{\"alignment\":\"center\",\"buttonText\":\"Visit the GiHub repo\",\"buttonUrl\":\"https://github.com/FergusKidd/Blender-to-Azure-custom-vision\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-16-at-10.22.42-1.png\",\"width\":4400,\"height\":2184}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-16-at-10.48.51.png\",\"width\":4042,\"height\":2404}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-16-at-10.51.49.png\",\"width\":4064,\"height\":2434}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-16-at-10.55.35.png\",\"width\":4060,\"height\":2438}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-16-at-11.00.16.png\",\"width\":4058,\"height\":2440}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Gaming technology and the technology that supports it has come a long way.

After talking with a few people, I realised not\neveryone cottoned on that it was even a digital render (the real thing is much\nmessier normally).\n\nThis gave me an idea.\nIf people can't really tell what's real once the stream has been compressed and\nsent over the internet, could a machine vision model? I've always been\ninterested in synthetic data creation for machine vision, but usually my\nstarting point has been something real, like a photograph. What if we could make\na working machine learning model with no real data at all?\n\nThe use case I chose was to find a tennis ball. Why? Well, it's about the size\nthat our stretch RE1 robot can grab well, and it won't matter if it's dropped or\nbumps into anything, so, I was hoping the resulting model could be used to help\nthe robot find and grab the tennis ball in the room. That's a challenge for\nanother day though.\n\nI started off with the 3D model of my room, and settled on the view from behind\nmy workstation.\n\nThen dropped a tennis ball onto the bed. (virtually). I wrote a script that can\nmove the ball around the room, change the lighting conditions, and then\nautomatically tag the ball location and upload it straight to Azure custom\nvision.\n\nVisit the GiHub repo\n[https://github.com/FergusKidd/Blender-to-Azure-custom-vision]This uses the\ncycles engine, with a de-noised image generation capped at about 30 seconds on\nmy machine. The beauty of this is you can easily change or limit the quality\noutput, or scale your compute power to generate many thousands of quality\npre-tagged images much faster than you could ever photograph a real scene and\nmanually tag it, assuming you don't have to build an environment from scratch\nlike I did here.\n\nPlaying around with the lighting conditions allows you to simulate lots of\ndifferent conditions, which from my past research, really help to build a more\nresilient object detection model.\n\nAll that's left to do is to click train, and test the results!\n\nThe real thing\nI used the minimum number of images required by Azure custom vision, just to\npush it to the max, but in reality with this method, you can keep adding camera\nviews, lighting setups and noising to you heart's content.\n\nFirst, let's test a real image from a similar viewpoint:\nThere we have it. The model has never seen a real tennis ball, but can identify\nthe real one with 93.1% confidence, even with the lowest amount of synthetic\ndata possibly generated.\n\nWhat if we show it an image it wasn't trained on, with more objects than\nexpected?\nWell, we had to reduce the confidence limit, but we have still correctly\nidentified all the tennis balls, even one from the reflection in the mirror.\n\nNext, the real thing from a different viewpoint:\nNot the highest confidences again, but still correct guesses - so this approach\nis still useable for a first pass where the context of the images meeds to\nchange.\n\nFinally, the same object but in a totally different context:\nSo, in a totally different context, it still works!\n\nImagine what we could do with many more renders, with no meed for any manual\ntagging, and looking at as many objects as we liked. There are great things\ngoing on in this sector from the likes of Unity as well, but for me, Blender\ngives the greatest flexibility on 3D rendering, with beautiful rendering\navailable completely for free.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-16-at-10.22.42.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2022-12-16T10:21:56.000Z","updated_at":"2022-12-16T11:02:34.000Z","published_at":"2022-12-16T11:02:35.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"628bad72d182030001125d37"},{"id":"63c1772dcf151900013c1ef2","uuid":"93b008e6-b69f-4695-9d0a-e2414417021a","title":"Generated Textures, but with depth","slug":"generated-textures-but-with-depth","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"button\",{\"alignment\":\"center\",\"buttonText\":\"Their GitHub\",\"buttonUrl\":\"https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/Cereal.png\",\"width\":1920,\"height\":1080}],[\"video\",{\"loop\":true,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2023/01/CerealExample.mp4\",\"fileName\":\"CerealExample.mp4\",\"width\":1920,\"height\":1080,\"duration\":17.650967,\"mimeType\":\"video/mp4\",\"thumbnailSrc\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/media-thumbnail-ember447.jpg\",\"thumbnailWidth\":1920,\"thumbnailHeight\":1080,\"cardWidth\":null}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"One very cool open source project has taken Stable diffusion into Blender.

I believe the recognition that comes with being part of the MVP community will give me a stronger platform to work from and share from. I hope that being part of the MVP community will also give me access to a diverse group of experts in their fields who I can continue to learn from, as well as find and explore new avenues of giving back to the wider community. I am also passionate about STEM education in young people and would want to use the MVP status to reach out to more students and young people to encourage them to pursue their passions in technology. I believe the resources offered as part of the MVP programme would allow me to build and share more adventurous and engaging demonstrations of technology on Microsoft Azure and allow me to host these demos in the public domain for easier sharing and interactions online.</p><p>What are the most impactful community contributions you've made in the last year?</p><p>•\tOver the last year I have grown my passion for sharing. From being invited as a keynote speaker to talk at the UCL centre for AI, to continuing to drive impact with junior achieve it Europe including being invited to speak with their CEO Salvatore Nigro about the Metaverse. I’ve also contributed to open-source work on GitHub, notably promoting the adoption of Microsoft generative AI, presenting back the impact of Microsoft text, vision and speech services, as well as openAI powered conversations in our Stretch RE1 robot. I also used a NextMind brain sensor to control the robot using only my mind, which has given me several opportunities to talk about that work in the public domain, where I always stress the ease and power of implementations of Microsoft AI.</p><p>What significant impact do you plan to make to the community in the upcoming year?</p><p>•\tIn the coming year I plan to continue to build, play, and share. I believe the most impactful sessions to share passion in technology contain a compelling story and vibrant demonstration that is relevant to the audience. I love to prove how easy it can be to reach a goal by starting from scratch with no technology experience. I plan to continue to engage with young people in STEM, and hopefully grow connections with local schools and university programs. I am especially interested in the use of gaming for education, and plan to use gaming concepts to engage young people in such topics as Metaverse, AI, and computer science using tools like Microsoft’s Minecraft for Education, Altspace VR, as well as utilising Unity or unreal engine.</p><p>What are you doing to make your community better? (e.g. charity work, diversity and inclusion efforts, education, mentoring, etc.)</p><p>•\tI am an active member of Avanade’s LGBTQ+ inclusion workstream, a group that advocates LGBTQ+ inclusion in the workplace in Europe and beyond. I work with a team in the UK to put on events, panels, talks, and information campaigns to highlight LGBTQ+ issues in the workplace and society. I am very proud that we have grown this group to be inclusive and collaborative across Europe.<br>•\tI mentor several groups and individuals from UCL as part of an Industry eXchange Network program I set up within Avanade. I set technical projects for them to complete, and mentor them, as well as providing technical guidance with Microsoft Azure. In a normal academic year I mentor 10-20 students<br>•\tI have been engaged with work experience programs at Avanade, welcoming in school students with a passion for technology and engaging them with the work we do around Microsoft. Specifically in terms of modern software engineering and artificial intelligence. This has been affected by Covid-19, but I hope to continue this in the future. I am also a registered STEM ambassador.<br>•\tI am an active member of the Green Software Foundation, and chair of one of the GSF projects. Working with companies and passionate people all around the world to make a greener and more sustainable future in software.</p>","comment_id":"66b4a237e5007a0001ba10d5","plaintext":"This page is an up to date list of activities relevant to the Microsoft MVP\naward scheme.

I believe the recognition that comes with being part of the MVP community\nwill give me a stronger platform to work from and share from. I hope that being\npart of the MVP community will also give me access to a diverse group of experts\nin their fields who I can continue to learn from, as well as find and explore\nnew avenues of giving back to the wider community. I am also passionate about\nSTEM education in young people and would want to use the MVP status to reach out\nto more students and young people to encourage them to pursue their passions in\ntechnology. I believe the resources offered as part of the MVP programme would\nallow me to build and share more adventurous and engaging demonstrations of\ntechnology on Microsoft Azure and allow me to host these demos in the public\ndomain for easier sharing and interactions online.\n\nWhat are the most impactful community contributions you've made in the last\nyear?\n\n•\tOver the last year I have grown my passion for sharing. From being invited as\na keynote speaker to talk at the UCL centre for AI, to continuing to drive\nimpact with junior achieve it Europe including being invited to speak with their\nCEO Salvatore Nigro about the Metaverse. I’ve also contributed to open-source\nwork on GitHub, notably promoting the adoption of Microsoft generative AI,\npresenting back the impact of Microsoft text, vision and speech services, as\nwell as openAI powered conversations in our Stretch RE1 robot. I also used a\nNextMind brain sensor to control the robot using only my mind, which has given\nme several opportunities to talk about that work in the public domain, where I\nalways stress the ease and power of implementations of Microsoft AI.\n\nWhat significant impact do you plan to make to the community in the upcoming\nyear?\n\n•\tIn the coming year I plan to continue to build, play, and share. I believe the\nmost impactful sessions to share passion in technology contain a compelling\nstory and vibrant demonstration that is relevant to the audience. I love to\nprove how easy it can be to reach a goal by starting from scratch with no\ntechnology experience. I plan to continue to engage with young people in STEM,\nand hopefully grow connections with local schools and university programs. I am\nespecially interested in the use of gaming for education, and plan to use gaming\nconcepts to engage young people in such topics as Metaverse, AI, and computer\nscience using tools like Microsoft’s Minecraft for Education, Altspace VR, as\nwell as utilising Unity or unreal engine.\n\nWhat are you doing to make your community better? (e.g. charity work, diversity\nand inclusion efforts, education, mentoring, etc.)\n\n•\tI am an active member of Avanade’s LGBTQ+ inclusion workstream, a group that\nadvocates LGBTQ+ inclusion in the workplace in Europe and beyond. I work with a\nteam in the UK to put on events, panels, talks, and information campaigns to\nhighlight LGBTQ+ issues in the workplace and society. I am very proud that we\nhave grown this group to be inclusive and collaborative across Europe.\n•\tI mentor several groups and individuals from UCL as part of an Industry\neXchange Network program I set up within Avanade. I set technical projects for\nthem to complete, and mentor them, as well as providing technical guidance with\nMicrosoft Azure. In a normal academic year I mentor 10-20 students\n•\tI have been engaged with work experience programs at Avanade, welcoming in\nschool students with a passion for technology and engaging them with the work we\ndo around Microsoft. Specifically in terms of modern software engineering and\nartificial intelligence. This has been affected by Covid-19, but I hope to\ncontinue this in the future. I am also a registered STEM ambassador.\n•\tI am an active member of the Green Software Foundation, and chair of one of\nthe GSF projects. Working with companies and passionate people all around the\nworld to make a greener and more sustainable future in software.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"page","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2024-08-08T10:47:19.000Z","updated_at":"2024-11-22T12:04:54.000Z","published_at":"2024-08-08T10:52:58.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"66e06f9355aa0d000107fa7a","uuid":"2784bda7-655e-43d1-b335-2a7362f8165f","title":"AI Videos with Runway","slug":"ai-videos","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/09/Untitled-start.png\",\"width\":1890,\"height\":1417}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/09/Untitled-2.png\",\"width\":1890,\"height\":1417}],[\"video\",{\"loop\":true,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2024/09/715fab5e-884b-4b54-8412-2c2caa9e4c93.mp4\",\"fileName\":\"715fab5e-884b-4b54-8412-2c2caa9e4c93.mp4\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":768,\"duration\":10.541667,\"mimeType\":\"video/mp4\",\"thumbnailSrc\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/09/media-thumbnail-ember115.jpg\",\"thumbnailWidth\":1280,\"thumbnailHeight\":768}],[\"video\",{\"loop\":true,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2024/09/6f778b11-e2c3-4f1f-a3a2-0eef695ce585.mp4\",\"fileName\":\"6f778b11-e2c3-4f1f-a3a2-0eef695ce585.mp4\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":768,\"duration\":10.541667,\"mimeType\":\"video/mp4\",\"thumbnailSrc\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/09/media-thumbnail-ember138.jpg\",\"thumbnailWidth\":1280,\"thumbnailHeight\":768}],[\"video\",{\"loop\":true,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2024/09/d345b91c-d274-4b0b-8726-58d3794d6b7f.mp4\",\"fileName\":\"d345b91c-d274-4b0b-8726-58d3794d6b7f.mp4\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":768,\"duration\":10.541667,\"mimeType\":\"video/mp4\",\"thumbnailSrc\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/09/media-thumbnail-ember150.jpg\",\"thumbnailWidth\":1280,\"thumbnailHeight\":768}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://runwayml.com/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I've been playing a little with AI generated videos.\"],[1,[],0,0],[1,[],0,1],[0,[],0,\"I used a very basic setup, taking a photo of me, and extending it to the correct frame dimensions with photoshop's generative fill.\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"became:\"]]],[10,1],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Then I simply ran it through \"],[0,[0],1,\"runway\"],[0,[],0,\", and looked at the results.\"]]],[10,2],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"This was the output with the least deformation of my face.
