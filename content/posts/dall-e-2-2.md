title: DALL-E-2 for Material Textures

slug: dall-e-2-2

<p>Playing around with DALL-E-2 a lot, both for work and fun, suddenly gave me an idea. What if DALL-E-2 could be useful for much more. I do a lot of 3D modelling too for fun, but a huge issue with amateur digital art is textures, and where to get them from. There a few great free resources, but many are credit based, and limit you in terms of quality and quantity. This can be quite annoying when you're only working on a prototype, or just want to see how something might look in a certain photo texture. Going to a search engine is a next step, but then you have to worry about copy write and watermarks. </p><p>Could DALL-E-2 be an easier way to generate testing textures? Clearly we won't be able to get depth information or anything without a lot of hard work, but could these work for background or supplementary textures?</p><p>Let's give it a shot!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.18.30---3d-textrue-of-a-rock.png" width="1024" height="1024" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.18.30---3d-textrue-of-a-rock.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.18.30---3d-textrue-of-a-rock.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.18.30---3d-textrue-of-a-rock.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.23.05---sand-texture.png" width="1024" height="1024" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.23.05---sand-texture.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.23.05---sand-texture.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.23.05---sand-texture.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.28.02---grass-texture.png" width="1024" height="1024" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.28.02---grass-texture.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.28.02---grass-texture.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.28.02---grass-texture.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.33.31---plain-white-paint-texture.png" width="1024" height="1024" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.33.31---plain-white-paint-texture.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.33.31---plain-white-paint-texture.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.33.31---plain-white-paint-texture.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.37.10---wooden-floor-texture.png" width="1024" height="1024" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.37.10---wooden-floor-texture.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.37.10---wooden-floor-texture.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-28-11.37.10---wooden-floor-texture.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-29-14.26.09---texture-of-ceramic-tile.png" width="1024" height="1024" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-29-14.26.09---texture-of-ceramic-tile.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-29-14.26.09---texture-of-ceramic-tile.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/DALL-E-2022-09-29-14.26.09---texture-of-ceramic-tile.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>I asked DALL-E-2 to produce several textures I might use in a project by simply thank thank typing 'texture of ....'</figcaption></figure><p>By simply asking for a texture, DALL-E-2 seems to know that we meed a nice flat image that looks fairly uniform. We can easily change details like the colour or grain of wood, simply by asking DALL-E for a variation. It could be a very quick and cost effective way to narrow down what thank you of texture you want before making an investment on your final choice. </p><h3 id="in-practice">In practice?</h3><p>What do these textures look like in practice? I threw some into a quick blender render to show you. A bit of playing with texture mapping made the wood texture a but more useful.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/BlenderDalleTextures.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/BlenderDalleTextures.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/BlenderDalleTextures.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2022/09/BlenderDalleTextures.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/BlenderDalleTextures.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see I did't even try to clean up the watermark in anyway, but you can quickly get a good idea of how different materials interact with light, and surfaces in your scene. </p><h3 id="what-it-cant-do">What it can't do</h3><p>DALL-E-2 does not seem to be able to generate the thank you're of seemless texture we would normally look for. That's ok for quick testing, </p><p>There's nothing stopping you from taking this idea further, and making a DALL-E-2 texture seemless, and then generating all the other versions we'd meed for high detail texturing though. DALL-E-2 actually comes in useful again, to join it's own seems up with in-painting.
