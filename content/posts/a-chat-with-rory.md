<p>Next up in my interviewing AI series... inspired by the OpenAI robotic announcements a week or two ago, I wanted to see how far I could get to replicating their video. We've not managed a robotic transformer for our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hello-robot-inc/">Hello Robot Inc</a> Stretch RE1 (we named Rory) yet, but watch this space.<br><br>This is a quick interview powered by GPT4 on Microsoft Azure including GPT-V powered vision processing. The voice is powered by OpenAI's text-to-speech models. I built the robot a self-aware persona with a touch of humour sprinkled in. <br><br>
