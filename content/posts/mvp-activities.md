With an academic background in physics and a professional focus on data science and artificial intelligence, Fergus has dedicated his career to exploring innovative uses of emerging technologies in the enterprise. His ongoing activities in the technology community demonstrate his commitment to the community and his ability to inspire others. He has been a keynote speaker at several events, including the University College London Centre for AI summer event and University of Central Florida honours program, co-organised numerous OpenUK meetups, and has made significant contributions to open-source initiatives. His online presence is notable, with tens of thousands of LinkedIn impressions and YouTube views on his work, including 'AI for productivity' and 'AI robot interviews' using Azure OpenAI. Additionally, as a STEM ambassador in the UK, Fergus is committed to inspiring school children in STEM subjects, further demonstrating his dedication to technology education and community leadership, both today and for the future.</div></div><div class="kg-card kg-header-card kg-width-full kg-size-small kg-style-accent" style="" data-kg-background-image=""><h2 class="kg-header-card-header" id="2024">2024</h2></div><h2 id="november">November</h2><p>MS Ignite - Chris and Zoe</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fergus-kidd-1a222667_ai-msignite-azure-activity-7264634774835621888-YFXN?utm_source&#x3D;share&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;member_desktop"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Fergus Kidd on LinkedIn: #ai #msignite #azure #openai #avanadedowhatmatters #mvpbuzz | 10 comments</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Ever needed to deliver something before the starting gun even fires?There&amp;#39;s an #AI for that. #MSIgnite is live NOW, but Zoe Wilson, Chris Lloyd-Jones, and I… | 10 comments on LinkedIn</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/al2o9zrvru7aqj8e1x2rzsrca" alt=""><span class="kg-bookmark-author">LinkedIn</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">Fergus Kidd</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E05AQHmHekUyzmCUA/videocover-high/videocover-high/0/1732018175433?e&#x3D;2147483647&amp;v&#x3D;beta&amp;t&#x3D;u3NfBTB7JHOnuxe8N89HotPYOhdScSKHQ5nf5fqJNXQ" alt=""></div></a></figure><p>AI Podcast - 4018 LinkedIn impressions</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LGOBPPi5_gw?list=PLKN6Sz7yuHvWP1_rzakBox88rdhJGJTfd" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>Human Agent Connection Podcast</p><p><strong>Add views </strong></p><h2 id="october">October</h2><p>AI Self interview</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://ferguskidd.com/live-ai-self-interview/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">LIVE!

I believe the recognition that comes with being part of the MVP community will give me a stronger platform to work from and share from. I hope that being part of the MVP community will also give me access to a diverse group of experts in their fields who I can continue to learn from, as well as find and explore new avenues of giving back to the wider community. I am also passionate about STEM education in young people and would want to use the MVP status to reach out to more students and young people to encourage them to pursue their passions in technology. I believe the resources offered as part of the MVP programme would allow me to build and share more adventurous and engaging demonstrations of technology on Microsoft Azure and allow me to host these demos in the public domain for easier sharing and interactions online.</p><p>What are the most impactful community contributions you've made in the last year?</p><p>•	Over the last year I have grown my passion for sharing. From being invited as a keynote speaker to talk at the UCL centre for AI, to continuing to drive impact with junior achieve it Europe including being invited to speak with their CEO Salvatore Nigro about the Metaverse. I’ve also contributed to open-source work on GitHub, notably promoting the adoption of Microsoft generative AI, presenting back the impact of Microsoft text, vision and speech services, as well as openAI powered conversations in our Stretch RE1 robot. I also used a NextMind brain sensor to control the robot using only my mind, which has given me several opportunities to talk about that work in the public domain, where I always stress the ease and power of implementations of Microsoft AI.</p><p>What significant impact do you plan to make to the community in the upcoming year?</p><p>•	In the coming year I plan to continue to build, play, and share. I believe the most impactful sessions to share passion in technology contain a compelling story and vibrant demonstration that is relevant to the audience. I love to prove how easy it can be to reach a goal by starting from scratch with no technology experience. I plan to continue to engage with young people in STEM, and hopefully grow connections with local schools and university programs. I am especially interested in the use of gaming for education, and plan to use gaming concepts to engage young people in such topics as Metaverse, AI, and computer science using tools like Microsoft’s Minecraft for Education, Altspace VR, as well as utilising Unity or unreal engine.</p><p>What are you doing to make your community better? (e.g. charity work, diversity and inclusion efforts, education, mentoring, etc.)</p><p>•	I am an active member of Avanade’s LGBTQ+ inclusion workstream, a group that advocates LGBTQ+ inclusion in the workplace in Europe and beyond. I work with a team in the UK to put on events, panels, talks, and information campaigns to highlight LGBTQ+ issues in the workplace and society. I am very proud that we have grown this group to be inclusive and collaborative across Europe.<br>•	I mentor several groups and individuals from UCL as part of an Industry eXchange Network program I set up within Avanade. I set technical projects for them to complete, and mentor them, as well as providing technical guidance with Microsoft Azure. In a normal academic year I mentor 10-20 students<br>•	I have been engaged with work experience programs at Avanade, welcoming in school students with a passion for technology and engaging them with the work we do around Microsoft. Specifically in terms of modern software engineering and artificial intelligence. This has been affected by Covid-19, but I hope to continue this in the future. I am also a registered STEM ambassador.<br>•	I am an active member of the Green Software Foundation, and chair of one of the GSF projects. Working with companies and passionate people all around the world to make a greener and more sustainable future in software.</p>
